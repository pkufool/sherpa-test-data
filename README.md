# sherpa-test-data

This repository contains the test data required by Sherpa (sherpa-onnx, sherpa-ncnn).

## How to use it?

The path of test data in the unit tests is hard-coded to `/tmp/sherpa-test-data`. Therefore, you just need to clone this repository to that directory.

```
git clone git@github.com:pkufool/sherpa-test-data.git /tmp/sherpa-test-data
```
